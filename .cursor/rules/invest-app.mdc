# InvestApp Project Rules

## 1. Framework
- Use **Vue 3** with Composition API and `<script setup>`.

## 2. UI Library
- Use **Vuetify 3** as the main UI library.
- All components must be customized to match the Figma design and Telegram Mini App style.

## 3. Styling
- Use **SCSS** for all custom styles.
- All custom styles must be placed in separate `.scss` files and imported into components as needed.
- Follow **BEM methodology** for class naming.

## 4. Mobile First
- All layouts and components must be designed **Mobile First** and fully responsive.
- Test all UI on different mobile screen sizes.

## 5. Routing
- Use **Vue Router** for navigation.
- Define all routes in a dedicated `router` directory/file.
- Use route guards if needed for navigation logic.

## 6. State Management
- Use **Pinia** for global state management.
- Use **Pinia Colada** for async data and mocking.
- Organize stores in a dedicated `stores` directory.

## 7. Data
- All data must be **mocked** using Pinia Colada.
- Structure the code so that switching to real API will require minimal changes.

## 8. Language
- Use **JavaScript (ESNext)** for all code.
- Do not use TypeScript.

## 9. Component Design
- All components must be **reusable** and follow **atomic design principles** (atoms, molecules, organisms).
- Place components in a structured `components` directory.
- Use props and emits for component communication.

## 10. Code Quality
- Write **clean, readable, and well-commented code**.
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting and linting.
- Fix all linter and formatter warnings before commit.

## 11. Commits
- Commit messages must be in **English** and follow the **Conventional Commits** style.
- Make small, atomic commits for each logical change.

## 12. Business Logic
- Separate business logic from UI components.
- Place business logic in **composables** or **stores**.

## 13. Configuration
- Use **environment variables** for all configuration.
- Do not hardcode any sensitive or environment-specific data.

## 14. Third-party Libraries
- All third-party libraries must be **approved** before use.
- Document the reason for adding any new dependency.

<!-- ## 15. Testing
- Write **unit tests** for all business logic and stores (if possible).
- Cover navigation and state logic with **integration or e2e tests** (if possible). -->

## 15. Figma
- Always check the **Figma design** before implementing or updating any UI https://www.figma.com/design/leuQycT60RTB5MuoGszv18/Kapitalist---Copy-for-client?node-id=2-4&p=f&t=7xRfmmfgild1bVPr-0.
- Match spacing, colors, and typography exactly as in the design.

## 16. Documentation
- Document all custom components, stores, and business logic.
- Update **README** with setup and usage instructions.

## 17. Push Policy
- All code must be pushed to the repository with clear commit messages.
- Do not push broken or untested code to the main branch.

## 18. Nuxt
- **Do not use Nuxt** in this project.

## 19. Review
- All code must be reviewed before merging to the main branch (if working in a team).

## 20. Atomic Design
- All UI components must be organized according to **atomic design principles**:
  - atoms — atomic elements (buttons, icons, input fields)
  - molecules — combinations of atoms (input with label, button with icon)
  - organisms — complex blocks (header, user card, lists)
- The structure must be reflected in `src/components/atoms`, `src/components/molecules`, `src/components/organisms`.
- Components should be as reusable and independent as possible.


- Always follow atomic design when adding new components.
